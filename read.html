    <p class="ac">When did you start your journey with yoga?</p>
    <p>I had I started playing volleyball really since elementary school but seriously since middle school and coming up on my sophomore year of high school I got a really bad back injury...Long story short our coach was just overworking us and I really overworked myself to the point of injury and I went to the doctor and they took an x-ray and everything and they were like you know the part of your lower back is splintering because of impact of jumping and just over-rotating when you hit.</p>
    <p>They recommended that I start doing yoga, so I started doing yoga as therapy at first and then it sort of just always was a thing that I did. I was always into stretching and just doing yoga sporadically but I didn’t have a daily practice until a couple of years ago when I moved back to New York and I really started doing it every day and I noticed that it was very therapeutic.
    </p>
    <p class="ac">How did you relationship with it change as you started to do it more often?></p>
    <p>I started seeing it more as holistic exercise as opposed to just some means of physical therapy.It became sort of emotional therapy, mental therapy and also an exercise. I very much see it now after practicing it consistently and going through teacher training and everything as a moving meditation.</p>
    <p>Whenever I do classes I set the time aside to really just like decompress and I don’t think about anything when I’m doing yoga now.</p>
    <p>So it really just feels like a breath of fresh air. As soon as I finish, there are physical benefits, like I can feel it in my abs, I can feel it in my muscles, but also I’m so much calmer and more relaxed as a person than I used to be. So I really notice the difference there.
    </p>
    <p class="ac">How frequently do you practice yoga, on like a weekly basis?</p>
    <p>Everyday. I would say like six times a week at least, definitely five times a week at a studio. But really I do some sort of movement with my body every single day.</p>
    <p class="ac">You’ve told me before that you did a program with Y7, that was a couple of weeks, how did that impact you and what was that experience like?</p>
    <p>So that was the 200-hour teacher training.</p>
    <p>You go through the history, the philosophy of the physical practice. You go through all of the different elements of what we consider yoga to be. Most people just consider it to be the physical practice, but its so much more than that. I was just kind of focused on the physical aspect of it, before I started, so I really learned a lot about my own body and my relationship with my body compared to other parts of my spirituality, my emotions, everything that I could be as a person, I learned a much more...I gained a much more holistic understanding of ‘the self’ through the practice, and I think that’s where it became really important.</p>
    <p>It transformed my physical practice too.</p>
    <p>I was able to like understand the greater depth of each pose and just like how things are meant to work. And I think especially in New York when you take a class you try to push through, and everything is momentum, momentum, um but this really allowed me to just like slow it down and there's been a significant difference between my momentum practice where I just sped through everything, thought it looked really cool, thought I looked really like  a badass and now I use blocks when I do poses. I take it slow. I’m not powering through the entire classes and I noticed a huge difference in that.

    <p class="ac">Do you think it was learning the history and the meaning behind the poses contributed to your change in practice?</p>
    <p>I don’t know that it was the history, I think it was just learning from yogis and practicing with them and having that experience.</p>
    <p>ou know, my teachers just said “hey, it’s fine to take a step back and just relax”, like they kind of brought a whole new perspective that I didn’t think about because I never...when you go to a yoga class you don’t really talk to anybody, you know, so hearing from them and having them teach us physically--this is why I think it’s important for everyone to have a private lesson when they first start--they would physically adjust us, they would tell us to slow down, they would count the breaths with us and you don’t have time to do that in a big class of like 30 people, you don’t have time to do that. But it was so individual and special that I really got a chance to just like sink into everything and let go.</p>
    <p>There was no pressure to perform, maybe that was it. There was no pressure to perform, so I just focused on what the purpose was behind it all. And the purpose isn’t just to get a flat stomach, so that's the difference. Before I had a hard time like making a distinction between and exercise and like exercise that encompasses everything.
    </p>
    <p class="ac">Before when you mentioned that breathwork was one of the things that you hadn't really paid as much attention to before, how is breathing integrated in yoga and why is the relationship between the two important.
    </p>
    <p>The relationship between the two is important because...in yoga you have like there is a way of breathing that goes through your entire body. There is the belief that you cannot get into certain poses like truly get into them if you don’t allow yourself to breathe in them and breathe through every inch of your muscles within those poses. </p>
    <p>It's like sequencing, so as you lengthen your body, for example, the idea is that you inhale and then you fill your whole body up to get to like the straightest, longest, most erect being. Then if you twist, you exhale and you twist. There is a purpose behind each breath, which is why its important to take it slow too because as you breathe in you lift your body up and raise your arms to the sky, as you exhale you fold forward. </p>
